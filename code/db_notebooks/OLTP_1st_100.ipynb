I had a bilateral mastectomy and now I'm on tamoxifen for the next 10 years. We're allowed to pause the tamoxifen after 2 years to try for pregnancy. We have one healthy embryo that doesn't have BRCA. Last night we told my husband's parents about the embryo and they were overjoyed! We swore them to secrecy because my parents and most of my support system are Catholic to the max and just wouldn't support this decision. It felt so good to tell my in-laws! In this Catholic community, there's a lot of pressure to procreate. I have so many friends that are pregnant right now. Even more that have little kids. They want to get together with me but I don't have children, and when we get together as a group they all just talk about their experiences of motherhood. (Experiences that really make me miss having estrogen and make me feel like an alien!) <br><br>I know all of them wonder what's going on with my health and fertility, but they are too kind to ask. I don't feel fully comfortable sharing. My therapist has recommended that I start to share. Not everyone is a safe space! Has anyone been through something like this? I'm not sure how to go about it and honestly I'm emotional about it so it all just feels very vulnerable. I wish I had some kind of catchphrase that I could share, but talking about my cancer at all seems to make everyone uncomfortable. I ended up telling one friend the whole story (minus the IVF) and asked if she could just spread the word. Hopefully, this makes everyone feel more comfortable.</td>\n",

I opted at first for all the routine screenings so I could focus on starting my family, etc. I decided that at 40 I would do all the preventative surgeries, but then it was COVID and I put it off. So now I'm back in it. My plastic surgeon suggested a reduction/lift followed by the PDMX and direct-to implants approx 3 months later. <br><br>I did the first phase of the reduction/lift in May. It went great - totally healed, etc. Initially, they said for that part that recovery was 2-4 weeks. I felt like it took barely 2. Drains were out after less-than 1 week. And even with the drains, I was pretty mobile. <br><br>So, the next part is now scheduled for 9/23. They told me that obvi this one is a bigger deal, and that I'd have two drains each side, instead of 1-each, and that recovery would be like 6-8 weeks.<br><br>SO my question is -- is recovery really that long? How long should I expect to be down; how long to expect drains? I live with husband and two young teens who are helpful and capable, but should I have my parents come out (across the country) to help? Husband can work from home the first few days, but will have to go back into the office. Kids will obvi be at school all day. Is it much harder/worse than the first procedure?<br><br>Does anyone have any insight to the healing portion? Will I need the extra help? I'm sure if my parents did not come out I can rely on my network for like meal trains, etc. <br><br>  <br>THANK YOU</td>\n",

I had my post-op last week (1 week out) and my plastic surgeon said he didn't like the look of some of the skin on my left side, but he wanted to give it another week so I went back in today. It's looking better but unfortunately I will need to have another procedure to remove some of the skin that isn't going to pull through. He did say that it's going to be significantly less than he anticipated, so I'm clinging to that silver lining. I'm back in Thursday so he can evaluate if I'm as healed as I'm going to get, or if he needs to wait another week. I might have this procedure as early as Friday. I unfortunately also have to keep my drains in.<br><br>I'm just struggling a lot emotionally. I trust my surgeons, and I know logically that this isn't anything I did or didn't do...but I'm feeling like it's a personal moral failing and I can't seem to shake that feeling. I'm the first of 4 BRCA2+ diagnosed female cousins on my mom's side to be able to have this procedure preventatively - 1 found cancer at her pre-op mammogram, 1 had DCIS, and another is dealing with metastatic breast cancer right now. I am so incredibly lucky. And I have an amazingly supportive family, and my husband has great insurance through his work so I'm not paying out of pocket for pretty much anything. I recognize how privileged I am, and I'm grateful.<br><br>I'm feeling this weird combination of survivor's guilt (I guess pre-vivor's guilt?) and shame and frustration. I think a part of me thought that since I was able to get this procedure preventatively that I had avoided the big bad outcome, so obviously that meant good outcomes for everything else? I know that's naive, but after sailing through recovery from the lift and reduction I assumed this procedure would go the same - maybe take a bit longer to recover, but I didn't anticipate this. My youngest daughter starts Kindergarten next week and I planned this whole thing so that I'd be more or less back on my feet by the time I had to walk her up to the bus stop at the end of our driveway. And regrettably life doesn't pause just because I'm recovering from surgery - and as lucky as I have been to be a stay at home mom these last 7 years, my kids are young enough that they still need me for a lot (or at least think they do) so it's not like I just get to focus solely on recovery.<br><br>I knew this would be a good place to come vent - my husband tries his best and I know he's there to support me no matter what, but he can't really understand some of the deeper underlying issues I'm processing through. Thanks for letting me vent.<br><br></td>\n",

I had some ischemia on one side but thankfully it did not turn into necrosis, it kind of turned dark and scabbed over, and then healed fine. <br><br>Fast forward some time, I started having occasional nipple discharge (usually after a shower/maybe from the heat) and that nipple felt “tighter” on that side, I just assumed it was because that side was always smaller and maybe there was just more room on my left breast with the implant. <br><br>I had an ultrasound and they were concerned by what they saw. I had a biopsy which cleared any malignancy and they found PASH, which I think is a type of normal breast tissue. I’ve since had another follow up ultrasound and the area is ill-defined but not growing. I’ve also been having more pain on that side only when I touch or massage, it’s just achey and not like the other side. I asked my surgeon and she said given the circumstances, she isn’t too concerned and thinks it’s just breast tissue that is left behind (which we know happens with mastectomy especially with nipple sparing) and likely as a result of some healing post necrosis. <br><br>Essentially my surgeon said if it’s really bothering me (pain wise, the nipple discharge) or just giving me stress/anxiety she can remove the nipple. My initial thought was no I can just suck it up but now I’m doubting myself, is there too much breast tissue left behind? Do I want to be dealing with these symptoms, even though they are fairly mild? She suggested I reach out to my reconstructive surgeon to see if he has any suggestions. <br><br>I think I need some advice on what factors I should consider with this decision. My biggest concern is my risk being higher with the tissue that’s there, but we know that mastectomy is not 100% with or without the nipples. If I choose to remove it, I may as well do both sides, and that’s a big surgery, for potentially more complications but maybe better peace of mind and no achey pain? And look wise I don’t know how they will manage removing the nipples after mastectomy has already been done. I don’t even know how to begin to sort out my thoughts!

Silicone implants placed over the muscle. <br><br>Recovery is going ok, aside from breaking out in painful hives from some contact dermatitis 😵‍💫<br><br>My question is: I can see very visible ripples at the top and sides of my implants. Not even when I’m bending over (which makes it worse), but just all the time. If I press my palm to my breast and gently apply pressure, the ripples go away. Is this something that might get better on its own as time passes? My plastic surgeon said that it can take 6 months for the implants to fully settle, and that the ripples could get better or they could actually get worse. I’m curious what your experience has been with this? Did your ripples smooth out on their own? I’m not loving the idea of a revision surgery, but it has been offered after the 6 month period. I’m feel impatient and just want to be done with this. <br><br>Thank you! </td>\n",

Except that she had a series of problems. First operation (knowing that the surgeon didn't even bother to come into the room to tell us how it went) my wife feels that something is wrong with her nipples and areolas but the surgeon lets it be known at the post-operative appointment that everything is fine. 1 week after loss of nipples and areolas during an emergency operation... 15 days later the scars reopen and start to necrotize again, my wife is taken urgently to a public hospital which is forced to remove everything.<br>Since then it's complicated for her, even if she doesn't admit it. My wife had a chest disproportionate to her thin waist and she loved it. Not having anything anymore, having stumps in place of breasts disturbs her enormously... She thinks she's ugly, doesn't know how to dress anymore, she who used to go topless at the beach might as well tell you that it's over... even the notion of going to the beach repels her. And in private, if I don't care, that's not the case. She had a very strong libido and for 2 years has found herself without a libido, with a lack of intimacy. There she has just learned that her future new attempt at reconstruction has been postponed because she has lost too much weight.<br>She wonders if she will be able to love herself again once the reconstruction is done and is successful, even if she must have a smaller breast than what she had and what she would like... especially since she will no longer have her nipples and her areolas, no more sensitivity.<br>Have any of you been there? Will she one day find herself beautiful again? She misses her libido and she wants to be sexy again and be able to go topless... But will she ever get there?<br>And me as a Spouse, what should I do to support her? Lately she even pushes me away... telling me \"if it doesn't work, let me go\"<br>I would like to be there for her but in the end she wants to be alone... impatient to get out of all these operations and finally, anxious about the final result, wants if one day she will find part of the woman she was before all this...</td>\n",

I have a part-time job that I get health benefits through, but it involves waking up super early and lifting a bunch of heavy stuff. I've been freaked out that the lack of sleep from that job is what's contributing to me having cancer in the first place and I don't want it to spread while I do, and my emotions are so all over since diagnosis I can't get through a day without crying, so I've taken unpaid time off for a few weeks while I wait for treatment dates and plan what's next. I'm going to ask for medical leave so I can keep my health benefits and avoid taking random time off for weeks during treatment.<br><br>My oncology team initially told me they would work around a vacation I had planned for about 6 months, and then ended up booking 3 procedures right on that week. So I don't get the only week of the year I have off with my partner, and had to cancel what I had booked for the trip. I then asked for a sick note from oncology because in that one week I have three medical procedures: a marker for surgery is being put in and then a scan (Monday), I have the radioactive injection the day before surgery for the sentinel node biopsy (Thursday), and a lumpectomy (Friday). I wanted the note from the Monday on (since I'll have to ask for 2 half days and a full day off for the actual procedures), and then the two weeks after surgery to recover (because recovery from the biopsy for me - they took 9 core samples and injected 3 markers - was 2 weeks before I could lift heavy boxes and move normally without pain), and I assume it will be the same/worse for the lumpectomy.<br><br>They just told me they will only give me the medical note for the 2 weeks after the surgery, because I'm \"not actually getting 3 medical procedures that week\". Like, girl what?? I was too shocked to say anything about the time I would need off that week, alone. That's at least 12 hours I have to ask for off, plus recovery time from those. They basically sent me a link to a therapy program I can apply for and told me to ask my GP for an over-arching medical note 'because I'm struggling'.<br><br>So now I feel like I'm being gaslit and/or over-reacting? Just, holy lack of empathy and understanding. I'm finding having to advocate for myself while trying to pay rent and resting more so exhausting. And then just to be given more to do, now, feels cruel. So far, finding out I have cancer has just been literally crying while I work my other job at home. It's awful.</td>\n",

I (21f) recently received news that my mom had suffered a reoccurrence of her breast cancer and am taking it particularly hard despite it seeming better than previous scans.<br><br>Some backstory: my mom (51f) is BRCA 2+ and has been battling stage 4 breast cancer for 6 years with a few reoccurrences and progressions, all typically resolved within a few cycles of chemo but never long lasting. The longest she’s been in “remission” is about a year. These past two years have been particularly grueling as there was a major progression to her lung that was missed in early stages that took very long to resolve. Moreso, the cancer switched from Her2+ to triple negative. Although the lung is no longer a concern, she’s been on chemo for the past two years straight due to minor reoccurrences that pop up each scan — even if all of the previous places resolved.<br><br>We are already in a much better place than we were last year, even with this new reoccurrence and she has never felt better both physically and mentally, but I can’t help but be discouraged by the continuous reoccurrences and treatments. She has had very little time to recover from the other ones and she is going to start a new chemo again where she will lose her hair for the second time now.<br><br>If anyone here has a similar experience or can share some encouragement I’d really appreciate it. I’m doing my best to support but I have to go back to college right before her treatment starts and it’s tearing me up that I can’t be at home with her. </td>\n",

The one decision I'm struggling with is whether to have a nipple-sparing mastectomy or not.<br><br>I'm 29 years old (as of today actually) and my two big concerns are:<br><br>1. If I do decide to spare the nipple, that will require an extra surgery. My breasts are such that to make the nipple-sparing work, I would need a breast reduction before the mastectomy. I would then have to wait five months after the reduction to get the mastectomy, which would mean I couldn't do it during the winter as I had hoped to.<br>2. If I decide not to spare the nipple, I won't have to get that extra surgery, but my concern is that I will have body image issues when I see my breasts without.<br><br>So I could use some advice from women who have had this procedure done before:<br><br>* For women who have gotten a nipple-sparing mastectomy, do you think it was worth it?<br>* For women who opted not to spare the nipple, do you regret it?

Ashkenazi Jewish, strong family history, all of that. My dad just tested positive for BRCA1, so the next step is to get me tested.<br><br>My CGC recommended that I take out a life insurance policy before testing, but I don’t know where to begin. Every policy I’ve looked at only allows 30 year terms, and I presume after 30 years + a possible BRCA1 diagnosis that it would be hard to renew the policy. <br><br>I know the next step is just to get tested and see, but I can’t help but think about all the possibilities. I would want to get the double mastectomy, but definitely have some concerns. I’m of course hesitant about the aesthetic aspect and it just not feeling like me. The recovery just also seems like a nightmare. I’m a full time grad student, going into a medical field, love working out and can’t imagine taking such a long break. Also cannot stop thinking about when I want to have kids one day and everything that might entail.<br><br>Any advice on life insurance/things to know before testing. Also would appreciate any advice in general. As you may tell I’m very anxious and tend to spiral.</td>\n",

Thinking it may just be a bug bite I didn't do anything with it for a while. Once the redness went down and the lump stayed I went to an oncologist who said it must be the implant and I need to go to my plastic surgeon. I just did an ultrasound and MRI and both came back showing no rupture or anything abnormal.

I am currently about to start the process of a double mastectomy and reconstruction and I hear lots of good and bad things about reconstructive options. I was just wondering if people could give me advice on what reconstructive options they had (over/under muscle implants or DIEP Flap fat transfer) and whether they are happy with the results. I totally get the aesthetics of the surgery isn’t the end goal and reducing the risk is. But I am still young and I want to be happy at the end of all this mayhem!<br><br>Thank you :)</td>\n",

I love your support and heart and your precious life itself!!🫶❤️‍🔥<br><br><br>⚡️ How were your mental, emotional, and physical impacts for you when it comes to have this type of surgery? Honestly my breasts are my favorite body parts. So I can’t imagine or process well if I loose them. <br><br>🌷 recovery time : I’ve been told was 8 weeks. Kaiser usually says shorter than the real time frame. What do you think? Is it accurate for you? <br><br>🛏️ How do you sleep after the surgery??? Face up only is the way? <br><br>🌻 I heard some people have a photoshoot or good bye boobies dinner with friends and do some kind of preparation and proper good bye for our awesome boobs. What did you do personally? if you don’t mind sharing of course. And what do you recommend? I’m thinking to do a photoshoot and also my friend is an artist so maybe I will ask her to draw??? What’s out there that I am missing?:) I’m so curious and I wanna appreciate and show love to my breasts and the entire body. <br><br>🌼 Do you actually enjoy and like your new breasts after the double mastectomy with reconstruction?? Sooo curious! would you mind sharing your thoughts, feelings, concerns??<br><br>🩵 I heard that after getting implants some people have immune problem which is a low possibility but there are some possibility and I’m concerned. Does anyone wanna say something about this? <br><br>💗 anything else that doctors don’t tell but we should be aware of or you wish someone told you before hand?? <br>I have a long list of questions here. if you could share even one of my questions is already great as well obviously. <br><br><br>Thank you so much for taking your time and reading it  thank you so much 🥰<br><br>Love you, Yosh🩵</td>\n",

That part resolved with 10 days of antibiotics but it made everything else recovery wise a bit slower.<br>I did my exercises,  did my walks, I recovered full arm motion and strength at around 5 months after surgery. <br>Sensation wise it still is weird, I need to be aware someone (like my lill one) is going for my chest, otherwise I might just jump away at touch because the area is ...its own kind of oversensitive bitch. Sometimes I still feel pain, but mostly not. Sometimes if I do a lot of physical effort involving the muscles in the area I can get some aches and stiffness, but all in all it's alright.<br><br>On a brighter note of things: OMG, men, is this how it is to live in a body with no heavy boobs wobbling around all the time? So so nice for my back, much less neck pain than before, everyone says I got a great posture now and I do generally feel comfortable with my new shape.<br>I won't lie, it's harder to hide the belly though :)))<br><br>Anyways,  I wish you all good luck with these crappy cards we've got! Hope you healing well and find some peace of mind too.</td>\n",

The genetic counselor was asking me about my feelings and I was like well this seems accurate to be honest. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Of course my husband and son are away on a trip to great wolf lodge and I was supposed to be relaxing and now I don't know what to do. Sorry for the word vomit, just processing. <br><br>I am 39, I've never had a mammogram, i planned on getting one when I turned 40 obviously but this is just so weird to me. The genetic counselor mentioned removing my ovaries and I'm thinking no I'll just wait until menopause at this point but I don't know.

I have seven days of filgrastim injections after each chemo. The first two times, my WCB count was great, not low at all. Round 3, my neutrophils dropped just below 1000 and we had to delay for a week. Now post round 4 they're almost 500! So delaying another week and hoping it's enough time. I also had to delay 2 weeks between rounds 1 and 2 due to an issue with my port incision not healing correctly. Which feels like a lot of delays!<br><br>I'm scared of being this vulnerable to infection, I have kids going back to school shortly ie bringing new germs home. We're being super strict about hygiene right now, I don't go to the grocery store, I mask up when I have to go outside, and I'm doing all I can to help myself heal. Daily walks, lots of water, increased protein, eating well. I always do all my filgrastim injections even though I hate them. The doctor says there's not really anything else I can do to increase WBC. I read on here that some people eat dark chocolate to help with WBC but also I've heard that the antioxidants can interfere with carboplatin and was warned by my oncologist to avoid things high in antioxodants like green tea... I hate all the confusion around what's safe during chemo! <br><br>I know there are risks associated with extended delays between doses, and also risks associated with decreasing dose %. I know sometimes when there has been febrile neutropenia and/or infection complications, they will lower the dose, but I feel sort of like why wait? Why not consider it as a preventative as my neutrophils have been decreasing each time? I hate being this vulnerable to illness and worry that all these delays will reduce the efficacy of chemo and I'll die. I'd like to ask my doctor about the pros and cons of reducing dose slightly to prevent febrile neutropenia, but worry that they won't want to consider it, or that it will be the wrong choice and render my chemo less effective and I'll die 🙃<br><br>Does anyone have any advice, or has anyone reduced their dose slightly in a case like this? I'm scared that next cycle my counts will be even lower and I'll get a serious illness, have to be admitted to hospital, or worse. Would really appreciate any advice, experiences, or encouragement!<br><br>Thank you 🩷</td>\n",

So ever since I have always known my risks.<br><br>Now that I turned 18 a few months ago, we decided to get me tested just in case. When we were there, the doctor told me that we can do it now or 7 years later when I am 25. That's because 25 is the age I'd have to get checked regularly. I decided that I'd be more comfortable with knowing it now than live with the question marks for 7 more years.<br><br>Now today it's here. The doctor calls and says I'm positive for the mutation. I wasn't shocked even though my mom is. As more and more time passes, I start feeling weird. Anxious. Somewhat scared. But I know I'm not scared because I just have the chance not the diagnose now. I try to tell myself that it's ok for me to feel a bit down for some time. But the worst feeling is that I don't really know what I'm feeling. I kinda feel like it doesn't really matter to me, as in \"yeah I have this gene mutation, so what, it's not like I'm dying\". I guess I am just confused and trying to settle with this new information.<br><br>  <br>So ig the reason I'm reaching out here is to know if there is any other younger people carrying this weight with them. All advice is welcome. I just needed to get this out there.<br><br>  <br>I wish all good success in life and all the health possible for each and everyone who reads this!<br><br>Thank you for your time<3</td>\n",

The GYN agreed to my request. <br><br>I was expecting a simple surgery and very easy recovery <br><br>HOWEVER - to get to my ovary, the GYN had to get through a lot of scar tissue from a c-sction 10+ years ago.  She basically took a chunk out of my abdomen and my recovery has been ROUGH.  <br><br>I was 90% bed bound for the first week.  Getting up and moving around is still so difficult (2 weeks post op). I can only stand/walk for short increments before I have to lay back down. <br><br>I though my movement was restricted with the mastectomy! I didn't realize how much you used your pectoral muscles. But man, you use your core for everything <br><br>At least with the mastectomy my surgeon put in a 5 day nerve block.  I still felt excruciating pain with chest movement or driving over bumpy roads. My abdominal pain wasn't quite at the same level (its close though), but it it so much more frequent. <br><br>I am recovering much faster than from the mastectomy. I thought this recovery would be a walk in the park but it has been a bitch. <br><br>Still I'd much rather do this now than when I'm sick<br><br>Side note - when my GYN took out the ovary she saw that it had endometriosis which explains why it had been bothering me. <br><br>Diagnosis: BRCA 1<br><br>Family History: <br><br>Maternal Grandmother - beat breast cancer 2x (in her 30s)<br><br>Mother - died from stage 4 ovarian (at 57) after fighting for 3+ years (the bad ass made it way longer than any of her doctors thought possible)  </td>\n",

I’m leaning towards having the hysterectomy with BSO first since I think recovery will be easier and I will be able to pick her up sooner. And then do the bilateral mastectomy in 6 months when she is 2. <br>However, I’ll have more recovery time available to me in November (8-10 weeks), so it might be better to have the mastectomy first. But she is still so little. I feel like at 2yo she’ll be a bit more independent and not needing to be picked up so much. But I have less time available in 6months for recovery (6-7 weeks).

Low and behold I felt a lump at 37 (last year) and got diagnosed with stage 2b triple negative breast cancer. I am also BRCA1+. So, I had to do all the cancer treatments which were 6 months of weekly chemo, immunotherapy, a double mastectomy and post surgical chemo too- all of that came with a myriad of complications. But now they’re (obviously) recommending an oopherectomy. Problem is- I haven’t had any kids yet. Life.. happened and it just hasn’t worked out yet. I’m currently on hormone blockers (Lupron- while on parp inhibitiors) and I’m nearly 39. I know they recommend getting tubes out soon but I was hoping to cash in on the very slim window I’ll have after active treatment and before oophorectomy.<br><br>So! After all that.. my question is- what ages have you all had that done if you have? What was it like in terms on the surgery and recovery time?<br>Thanks!</td>\n",

I had a bilateral mastectomy and now I'm on tamoxifen for the next 10 years. We're allowed to pause the tamoxifen after 2 years to try for pregnancy. We have one healthy embryo that doesn't have BRCA. Last night we told my husband's parents about the embryo and they were overjoyed! We swore them to secrecy because my parents and most of my support system are Catholic to the max and just wouldn't support this decision. It felt so good to tell my in-laws! In this Catholic community, there's a lot of pressure to procreate. I have so many friends that are pregnant right now. Even more that have little kids. They want to get together with me but I don't have children, and when we get together as a group they all just talk about their experiences of motherhood. (Experiences that really make me miss having estrogen and make me feel like an alien!)                                                 |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I don't feel fully comfortable sharing. My therapist has recommended that I start to share. Not everyone is a safe space! Has anyone been through something like this? I'm not sure how to go about it and honestly I'm emotional about it so it all just feels very vulnerable. I wish I had some kind of catchphrase that I could share, but talking about my cancer at all seems to make everyone uncomfortable. I ended up telling one friend the whole story (minus the IVF) and asked if she could just spread the word. Hopefully, this makes everyone feel more comfortable.                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I opted at first for all the routine screenings so I could focus on starting my family, etc. I decided that at 40 I would do all the preventative surgeries, but then it was COVID and I put it off. So now I'm back in it. My plastic surgeon suggested a reduction/lift followed by the PDMX and direct-to implants approx 3 months later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

It went great - totally healed, etc. Initially, they said for that part that recovery was 2-4 weeks. I felt like it took barely 2. Drains were out after less-than 1 week. And even with the drains, I was pretty mobile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

They told me that obvi this one is a bigger deal, and that I'd have two drains each side, instead of 1-each, and that recovery would be like 6-8 weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

How long should I expect to be down; how long to expect drains? I live with husband and two young teens who are helpful and capable, but should I have my parents come out (across the country) to help? Husband can work from home the first few days, but will have to go back into the office. Kids will obvi be at school all day. Is it much harder/worse than the first procedure?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I had my post-op last week (1 week out) and my plastic surgeon said he didn't like the look of some of the skin on my left side, but he wanted to give it another week so I went back in today. It's looking better but unfortunately I will need to have another procedure to remove some of the skin that isn't going to pull through. He did say that it's going to be significantly less than he anticipated, so I'm clinging to that silver lining. I'm back in Thursday so he can evaluate if I'm as healed as I'm going to get, or if he needs to wait another week. I might have this procedure as early as Friday. I unfortunately also have to keep my drains in.                                                                                                                                                    |   10  |     0.92     |      6       |                                                               <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1n0t7x9/disappointment_after_pdmx_complications/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1n0t7x9/disappointment_after_pdmx_complications/</a>                                                               |  1756231613 | 2025-08-26 18:06:53+00:00 |\n",

I trust my surgeons, and I know logically that this isn't anything I did or didn't do...but I'm feeling like it's a personal moral failing and I can't seem to shake that feeling. I'm the first of 4 BRCA2+ diagnosed female cousins on my mom's side to be able to have this procedure preventatively - 1 found cancer at her pre-op mammogram, 1 had DCIS, and another is dealing with metastatic breast cancer right now. I am so incredibly lucky. And I have an amazingly supportive family, and my husband has great insurance through his work so I'm not paying out of pocket for pretty much anything. I recognize how privileged I am, and I'm grateful.                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I think a part of me thought that since I was able to get this procedure preventatively that I had avoided the big bad outcome, so obviously that meant good outcomes for everything else? I know that's naive, but after sailing through recovery from the lift and reduction I assumed this procedure would go the same - maybe take a bit longer to recover, but I didn't anticipate this. My youngest daughter starts Kindergarten next week and I planned this whole thing so that I'd be more or less back on my feet by the time I had to walk her up to the bus stop at the end of our driveway. And regrettably life doesn't pause just because I'm recovering from surgery - and as lucky as I have been to be a stay at home mom these last 7 years, my kids are young enough that they still need me for a lot (or at least think they do) so it's not like I just get to focus solely on recovery.                          |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I had a biopsy which cleared any malignancy and they found PASH, which I think is a type of normal breast tissue. I’ve since had another follow up ultrasound and the area is ill-defined but not growing. I’ve also been having more pain on that side only when I touch or massage, it’s just achey and not like the other side. I asked my surgeon and she said given the circumstances, she isn’t too concerned and thinks it’s just breast tissue that is left behind (which we know happens with mastectomy especially with nipple sparing) and likely as a result of some healing post necrosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

My initial thought was no I can just suck it up but now I’m doubting myself, is there too much breast tissue left behind? Do I want to be dealing with these symptoms, even though they are fairly mild? She suggested I reach out to my reconstructive surgeon to see if he has any suggestions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

My biggest concern is my risk being higher with the tissue that’s there, but we know that mastectomy is not 100% with or without the nipples. If I choose to remove it, I may as well do both sides, and that’s a big surgery, for potentially more complications but maybe better peace of mind and no achey pain? And look wise I don’t know how they will manage removing the nipples after mastectomy has already been done. I don’t even know how to begin to sort out my thoughts! I would love to hear what others would do in my situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

Not even when I’m bending over (which makes it worse), but just all the time. If I press my palm to my breast and gently apply pressure, the ripples go away. Is this something that might get better on its own as time passes? My plastic surgeon said that it can take 6 months for the implants to fully settle, and that the ripples could get better or they could actually get worse. I’m curious what your experience has been with this? Did your ripples smooth out on their own? I’m not loving the idea of a revision surgery, but it has been offered after the 6 month period. I’m feel impatient and just want to be done with this.                                                                                                                                                                      |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

Except that she had a series of problems. First operation (knowing that the surgeon didn't even bother to come into the room to tell us how it went) my wife feels that something is wrong with her nipples and areolas but the surgeon lets it be known at the post-operative appointment that everything is fine. 1 week after loss of nipples and areolas during an emergency operation... 15 days later the scars reopen and start to necrotize again, my wife is taken urgently to a public hospital which is forced to remove everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

My wife had a chest disproportionate to her thin waist and she loved it. Not having anything anymore, having stumps in place of breasts disturbs her enormously... She thinks she's ugly, doesn't know how to dress anymore, she who used to go topless at the beach might as well tell you that it's over... even the notion of going to the beach repels her. And in private, if I don't care, that's not the case. She had a very strong libido and for 2 years has found herself without a libido, with a lack of intimacy. There she has just learned that her future new attempt at reconstruction has been postponed because she has lost too much weight.                                                                                                                                                                       |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I am 2 weeks out from getting my mastectomy. For reference i am 22, just graduated college, and wanting to get this done ASAP. I have a long fhx of breast cancer and unfortunately have the genes to be at a very high risk. I am super super nervous and stressed about this procedure, so for those who went through this I have some questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   7   |     0.89     |      15      |                                                                           <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mzlu9p/prolyphic_double_mastectomy/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mzlu9p/prolyphic_double_mastectomy/</a>                                                                           |  1756114203 | 2025-08-25 09:30:03+00:00 |\n",

Does it look noticeable in shirts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I am pursuing a prophylactic mastectomy as my lifetime risk is 50%. Expanders and then an implant literally nearly killed my sister so don’t want any part of those. God bless you ladies who have gone this route. I am 64 in superb health with enough tummy to make breasts. I am scared of the long-ass surgery and the recovery. I have plenty of leave from work. I’m lucky. However, I am very drawn to one and done. Can others share opinions? I am meeting surgeons after Labor Day. The thought of ramping up for 2nd surgery DIEP really wears me out, but if the pain from all at once is severe I will consider. Grateful for you, ladies.                                                                                                                                                                    |   6   |     1.0      |      17      |                                                                          <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mzdynv/diep_flap_right_away_or_wait/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mzdynv/diep_flap_right_away_or_wait/</a>                                                                          |  1756086590 | 2025-08-25 01:49:50+00:00 |\n",

I have a part-time job that I get health benefits through, but it involves waking up super early and lifting a bunch of heavy stuff. I've been freaked out that the lack of sleep from that job is what's contributing to me having cancer in the first place and I don't want it to spread while I do, and my emotions are so all over since diagnosis I can't get through a day without crying, so I've taken unpaid time off for a few weeks while I wait for treatment dates and plan what's next.

So I don't get the only week of the year I have off with my partner, and had to cancel what I had booked for the trip. I then asked for a sick note from oncology because in that one week I have three medical procedures: a marker for surgery is being put in and then a scan (Monday), I have the radioactive injection the day before surgery for the sentinel node biopsy (Thursday), and a lumpectomy (Friday). I wanted the note from the Monday on (since I'll have to ask for 2 half days and a full day off for the actual procedures), and then the two weeks after surgery to recover (because recovery from the biopsy for me - they took 9 core samples and injected 3 markers - was 2 weeks before I could lift heavy boxes and move normally without pain), and I assume it will be the same/worse for the lumpectomy.                                     |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

Like, girl what?? I was too shocked to say anything about the time I would need off that week, alone. That's at least 12 hours I have to ask for off, plus recovery time from those. They basically sent me a link to a therapy program I can apply for and told me to ask my GP for an over-arching medical note 'because I'm struggling'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

The longest she’s been in “remission” is about a year. These past two years have been particularly grueling as there was a major progression to her lung that was missed in early stages that took very long to resolve. Moreso, the cancer switched from Her2+ to triple negative. Although the lung is no longer a concern, she’s been on chemo for the past two years straight due to minor reoccurrences that pop up each scan — even if all of the previous places resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

She has had very little time to recover from the other ones and she is going to start a new chemo again where she will lose her hair for the second time now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

If I do decide to spare the nipple, that will require an extra surgery. My breasts are such that to make the nipple-sparing work, I would need a breast reduction before the mastectomy. I would then have to wait five months after the reduction to get the mastectomy, which would mean I couldn't do it during the winter as I had hoped to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

Every policy I’ve looked at only allows 30 year terms, and I presume after 30 years + a possible BRCA1 diagnosis that it would be hard to renew the policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I would want to get the double mastectomy, but definitely have some concerns. I’m of course hesitant about the aesthetic aspect and it just not feeling like me. The recovery just also seems like a nightmare. I’m a full time grad student, going into a medical field, love working out and can’t imagine taking such a long break. Also cannot stop thinking about when I want to have kids one day and everything that might entail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

Like, do we get a double win?! Prettier boobs and smaller flanks?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   5   |     0.78     |      5       |                                                                    <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mwnqz0/fat_grafting_with_exchange_surgery/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mwnqz0/fat_grafting_with_exchange_surgery/</a>                                                                    |  1755811514 | 2025-08-21 21:25:14+00:00 |\n",

Randomly about 4 months ago I happened to notice a lump on the top of my implant, it was odd, it was right under my skin and on top of the implant it even made a round dot on my skin for a few days. Thinking it may just be a bug bite I didn't do anything with it for a while. Once the redness went down and the lump stayed I went to an oncologist who said it must be the implant and I need to go to my plastic surgeon. I just did an ultrasound and MRI and both came back showing no rupture or anything abnormal. But the lump is still there and while it's not visible I can feel it when I touch it, has anyone ever had anything like this where they had a silent rupture that didn't show in imaging?                                                                                                                                                     |   2   |     1.0      |      3       |                                                                  <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mwcp77/lump_on_top_of_implant_after_7_years/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mwcp77/lump_on_top_of_implant_after_7_years/</a>                                                                  |  1755786968 | 2025-08-21 14:36:08+00:00 |\n",

I am currently about to start the process of a double mastectomy and reconstruction and I hear lots of good and bad things about reconstructive options. I was just wondering if people could give me advice on what reconstructive options they had (over/under muscle implants or DIEP Flap fat transfer) and whether they are happy with the results. I totally get the aesthetics of the surgery isn’t the end goal and reducing the risk is. But I am still young and I want to be happy at the end of all this mayhem!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I didn’t hear anything about those results either, and I figured no news was good news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

Today, I was told I tested positive for the BRCA2 mutation, which puts me at high risk for breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. I was also told I have pelvic congestion syndrome and adenomyosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

At the same time, another part of me feels grief because I am being told they recommend removing my uterus due to PCS and adenomyosis. I am 40 years old and have three amazing boys. They have kept me grounded today, and I feel so blessed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

It is small enough and early stage and I could opt to have a lumpectomy again.  I had lumpectomy the first time followed by radiation.  If I have a mastectomy I am not having reconstruction but going flat.  Any thoughts on wisdom or not of doing the mastectomy because it is the second time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   8   |     1.0      |      11      |                                                                                       <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1n4e2v3/choices/>https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1n4e2v3/choices/</a>                                                                                       |  1756591869 | 2025-08-30 22:11:09+00:00 |\n",

I don’t expect him to know *everything*. But recently she’s started getting a neative results (a good thing) but at the same time her CA125 is creeping up a little (about half a point every time). It’s still at 13 which is good. But we’re just confused how the Natera test ties in and what it means for her overall prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I’m Yosh! 39 years old. BRCA1 positive. I had full hysterectomy this end of March 2025. Thinking to do preventative double mastectomy with reconstruction sometime this year or next year. What should I expect from this surgery? if you have any knowledge, experience, and wisdom, would you so graciously give me some nuggets? because I talked to a breast surgeon before but I wanna hear from the real people who have gone through this. thank you ladies! I love your support and heart and your precious life itself!!🫶❤️‍🔥                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   12  |     1.0      |      40      |                                                        <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mv65j4/have_you_had_preventative_double_mastectomy_im/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mv65j4/have_you_had_preventative_double_mastectomy_im/</a>                                                        |  1755667706 | 2025-08-20 05:28:26+00:00 |\n",

Sometimes I still feel pain, but mostly not. Sometimes if I do a lot of physical effort involving the muscles in the area I can get some aches and stiffness, but all in all it's alright.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I’m coping fairly well but I’m still filled with grief and fear. It comes in waves and some days are really difficult. I’m seeing a therapist twice a week so I am getting professional help. Is there any thing you all have done to support your mental health during difficult moments?  Any thoughts or coping skills that have helped you get through it? Any tips for supporting body positivity?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I did 23andMe in 2020 and was told I was negative for either. That made sense to me since there is zero other cancer in my family history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   5   |     0.86     |      19      |                                                                  <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mu3xlt/so_i_thought_i_didnt_have_itbut_i_do/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mu3xlt/so_i_thought_i_didnt_have_itbut_i_do/</a>                                                                  |  1755564356 | 2025-08-19 00:45:56+00:00 |\n",

I gave dna for an unrelated reason because I have MS and I got a call from the genetic counselor today saying I am brca2+, just with a rare mutation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

My whole life has been one problem after another. The genetic counselor was asking me about my feelings and I was like well this seems accurate to be honest. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Of course my husband and son are away on a trip to great wolf lodge and I was supposed to be relaxing and now I don't know what to do.

The genetic counselor mentioned removing my ovaries and I'm thinking no I'll just wait until menopause at this point but I don't know. It's just so strange to have no family history of cancer and be told this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

But I'm feeling so frustrated! I've done 4/6 rounds of trastuzumab, carbo and paclitaxel every 3 weeks for +++ IDC. I have seven days of filgrastim injections after each chemo. The first two times, my WCB count was great, not low at all. Round 3, my neutrophils dropped just below 1000 and we had to delay for a week. Now post round 4 they're almost 500! So delaying another week and hoping it's enough time. I also had to delay 2 weeks between rounds 1 and 2 due to an issue with my port incision not healing correctly. Which feels like a lot of delays!                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   5   |     0.86     |      1       |                                                                 <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1n4auns/delays_due_to_low_neutrophils/>https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1n4auns/delays_due_to_low_neutrophils/</a>                                                                 |  1756583485 | 2025-08-30 19:51:25+00:00 |\n",

We're being super strict about hygiene right now, I don't go to the grocery store, I mask up when I have to go outside, and I'm doing all I can to help myself heal. Daily walks, lots of water, increased protein, eating well. I always do all my filgrastim injections even though I hate them. The doctor says there's not really anything else I can do to increase WBC. I read on here that some people eat dark chocolate to help with WBC but also I've heard that the antioxidants can interfere with carboplatin and was warned by my oncologist to avoid things high in antioxodants like green tea... I hate all the confusion around what's safe during chemo!                                                                                                                                         |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I know sometimes when there has been febrile neutropenia and/or infection complications, they will lower the dose, but I feel sort of like why wait? Why not consider it as a preventative as my neutrophils have been decreasing each time? I hate being this vulnerable to illness and worry that all these delays will reduce the efficacy of chemo and I'll die. I'd like to ask my doctor about the pros and cons of reducing dose slightly to prevent febrile neutropenia, but worry that they won't want to consider it, or that it will be the wrong choice and render my chemo less effective and I'll die 🙃                                                                                                                                                                  |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I was tested through Ambry Genetics and my insurance told me it was in network, and Ambry's website makes it seem like you only pay a few hundred dollars if anything. I just received my bill and it is almost 4K (I literally had 1 vial of blood taken).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I have known and thought my whole life that I do have higher chance of cancer. That's because my mother got diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 9 months pregnant with me and 8 years later it came back. So ever since I have always known my risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

When we were there, the doctor told me that we can do it now or 7 years later when I am 25. That's because 25 is the age I'd have to get checked regularly. I decided that I'd be more comfortable with knowing it now than live with the question marks for 7 more years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

The doctor calls and says I'm positive for the mutation. I wasn't shocked even though my mom is. As more and more time passes, I start feeling weird. Anxious. Somewhat scared. But I know I'm not scared because I just have the chance not the diagnose now. I try to tell myself that it's ok for me to feel a bit down for some time. But the worst feeling is that I don't really know what I'm feeling. I kinda feel like it doesn't really matter to me, as in \"yeah I have this gene mutation, so what, it's not like I'm dying\". I guess I am just confused and trying to settle with this new information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I hadn’t considered fat grafting until the doctor mentioned it. I will of course be asking them most of these questions too but wanted to hear other people’s experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

Getting up and moving around is still so difficult (2 weeks post op). I can only stand/walk for short increments before I have to lay back down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I didn't realize how much you used your pectoral muscles.

I still felt excruciating pain with chest movement or driving over bumpy roads. My abdominal pain wasn't quite at the same level (its close though), but it it so much more frequent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I’m leaning towards having the hysterectomy with BSO first since I think recovery will be easier and I will be able to pick her up sooner. And then do the bilateral mastectomy in 6 months when she is 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

But she is still so little. I feel like at 2yo she’ll be a bit more independent and not needing to be picked up so much. But I have less time available in 6months for recovery (6-7 weeks). I can’t decide!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I’ll be 40 in January.

I struggled to decide on if I wanted to do fat grafting or not, but eventually decided on agreeing to it because I do not want to see any rippling, and I want my chest to be as natural as possible, as well as minimize the chances for wanting a revision pretty soon because I’m getting removed from my parents insurance at the end of the year with no guarantee from my job of being able to get insurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |   4   |     0.84     |      10      |                                                                             <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1msgvqx/questions_on_fat_grafting/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1msgvqx/questions_on_fat_grafting/</a>                                                                             |  1755403044 | 2025-08-17 03:57:24+00:00 |\n",

From my understanding, he said it’s effectively liposuction and then they inject the fat up top?

I’ve looked at non hormonal for the obvious bc implications of the alternative, but seems to be that the only option is for the copper coil which seems to have some brutal side effects. Just wondering what everyone is using or if anyone has advice? My midwife was pushing towards the copper coil quite heavily but as someone who gets horrific migraines around their period I don’t really fancy a birth control that can make your periods heavier and longer 🤷🏻‍♀️                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   2   |     1.0      |      11      |                                                                                         <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1ms72ky/birth_control/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1ms72ky/birth_control/</a>                                                                                         |  1755376825 | 2025-08-16 20:40:25+00:00 |\n",

Kinda stresses me out knowing that my future could look like if I did inherit it and I do know theres a 50% chance I did. I do want to know whether or not I have it that way if I don't then I can stop worrying and be relieved. However I am not sure how me having it can affect things like  insurance, life insurance, and a health insurance plan so I am not sure if I should try to lock all of these in place first or just how to go about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I have an appointment to meet with a genetics counselor in a few weeks. I’m still taking in all of the information, but I curious if anyone has decided to not have preventative surgeries? I’m all for the peace of mind for after, but terrified of surgery and recovery- I’m also afraid of the side effects of chemo and radiation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   2   |     1.0      |      20      |                                                                                     <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mql89q/undecided_surgery/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mql89q/undecided_surgery/</a>                                                                                     |  1755225586 | 2025-08-15 02:39:46+00:00 |\n",

My half sister had breast cancer at 24, my aunt had ovarian and breast cancer starting in her late 40s. My mother had breast cancer at 66, but was BRCA negative- it’s clearly from my dad’s side. She passed when I was 38 from complications with chemo and radiation, but was cleared of cancer at the time. I plan on asking the genetics counselor how much lifestyle and personal health choices can swing the odds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |       |              |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |             |                           |\n",

I’m new to this page but not this nightmare unfortunately. My grandmother died of breast cancer and my mother had breast cancer in her late 30’s. She tested later in life for BRCA mutations when that became a thing (about 15 years ago) and was positive for BRCA1. My sister also got tested at that time and came up negative. Low and behold I felt a lump at 37 (last year) and got diagnosed with stage 2b triple negative breast cancer. I am also BRCA1+. So, I had to do all the cancer treatments which were 6 months of weekly chemo, immunotherapy, a double mastectomy and post surgical chemo too- all of that came with a myriad of complications. But now they’re (obviously) recommending an oopherectomy. Problem is- I haven’t had any kids yet. Life.. happened and it just hasn’t worked out yet. I’m currently on hormone blockers (Lupron- while on parp inhibitiors) and I’m nearly 39. I know they recommend getting tubes out soon but I was hoping to cash in on the very slim window I’ll have after active treatment and before oophorectomy. |   4   |     0.84     |      20      |                                                                              <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mqebs9/oophorectomy_at_what_age/>https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCA/comments/1mqebs9/oophorectomy_at_what_age/</a>                                                                              |  1755207953 | 2025-08-14 21:45:53+00:00 |\n",

I did 6 weeks (30 sessions) of radiation and oral capecitabine.  Not gonna lie. The radiation was awful and took me 7 weeks to heal from the burns. I also had a colostomy bag installed. I've since had 8 chemo treatment rounds of oxaliplatin and avastin (bevacizumab) and capecitabine.  I get scans every 3 months and my last scan said \"significant improvement \". I've been told I'm chemo for life. I live my life. I retired from work and am now a stay at home mom which i love. I deal with my colostomy bag, its taken 10 months to become 95% comfortable with it.

After 9 rounds they stopped since there wasn’t improvement and now I’ll be starting a new treatment with mekanist.

I tend to get nervous because \"surgery hasn't even been done yet, just get it out!!\" Is what I end up thinking about. But like you said I don't know if it did or didn't work yet, and if it didn't, there's much more to try. The goal with this chemo is to get things to the best condition to get the cancer out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   1   |  1756513793 | 2025-08-30 00:29:53+00:00 |\n",

I was told i had haemorrhoids/fissures/was constipated..eventually my doctor made a referral for a colonoscopy and it was stage 4 (lymph nodes and another tumor was found). I did 6 weeks (30 sessions) of radiation and oral capecitabine.  Not gonna lie. The radiation was awful and took me 7 weeks to heal from the burns. I also had a colostomy bag installed. I've since had 8 chemo treatment rounds of oxaliplatin and avastin (bevacizumab) and capecitabine.  I get scans every 3 months and my last scan said \"significant improvement \". I've been told I'm chemo for life. I live my life. I retired from work and am now a stay at home mom which i love. I deal with my colostomy bag, its taken 10 months to become 95% comfortable with it. I see the positives  I'm alive, I have my children and my husband. I hope your story becomes a successful one |   3   |  1756711989 | 2025-09-01 07:33:09+00:00 |\n",

My doc ignored my CA-125 he said it’s not a reliable source like the scans. And  it’s ok if the Avastin doesn’t work, it just means you need a different route (: I used to get upset about my CA125, but after being with my doc for so long and it finally sinking in my case isn’t the same for everyone, I accepted it. And also that there are many options for treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   1   |  1756513555 | 2025-08-30 00:25:55+00:00 |\n",

I have been living with very severe COPD for a number of years. My palliative care through my oncologist prescribed liquid morphine to help with the air hunger. I only take .25ml -.50 ml, a baby dose to help me function, it doesn’t make me loopy or sleepy. It’s very common in pulmonary in the later stage when inhalers aren’t enough. It suppresses the respiratory drive, slowing down your perceived need to breathe. Unfortunately it doesn’t last long. I knew someone that had been prescribed a time release morphine to help with his dyspnea. Might be worth a conversation with your oncologist so you can get some relief.

Diagnosed at 12 months, surgery, chemo radiation.  He has been cancer free for 14 years now and we still worry about every little developmental thing.  Is it because of the chemo, radiation, or is it just him?  You'll never know and you can drive yourself mad worrying about it.  We have to remind ourselves how lucky we are to have him and take things as they come.  People underestimate the effect on survivors, especially parents of pediatric survivors. If it's really bad I suggest talk therapy and possibly meds.                                                                                                                                                            |   4   |  1756691420 | 2025-09-01 01:50:20+00:00 |\n",

Every article is capped off with a recipe for an anti-cancerous meal. It might be able to give you some perspective as to what's to come for your son? I do my best to stay positive about very morbid situations. I think it could be beneficial for you to know it gets better.

It does feel like we have tried to stay outwardly positive and happy for so long that we never actually let ourselves grieve the potential life we and he is missing out on, or even really acknowledge what we went through.  As every time we do start to think or talk about it, we immediately turn it into thinking we shouldn't be complaining but we should be happy he survived.  If that makes sense.  (When I say we, I mean my wife and I; she is also struggling and admits she has still not got over it).                                                                                                                                                              |   4   |  1756674000 | 2025-08-31 21:00:00+00:00 |\n",

I can only imagine what you must be going through though, having to do it while raising and protecting your young daughter.   Wishing good things for you and your family too.

And my thoughts are with you for having gone through it all too.  I agree about the worry over every developmental thing.

I appreciate your answer.  I have had therapy, however even with that, the people I have seen have not been through the same experience, and although I know they sympathize and have provided advice, it just feels like standard advice I can read in self help books.  And I know it makes me sound like I almost don't want to get better, or get over it, but it's just a wall that I hit everyday.  I do think I need to look into again though, and find the right person to speak to.                                                                                                                                                                      |   3   |  1756673669 | 2025-08-31 20:54:29+00:00 |\n",

Turned out to be Stage 1A. I had a radical hysterectomy and needed NO further treatment (no chemo/radiation), and that was 3 years ago.

Totally normal to be freaked out, but you've still got plenty of room for it to be not nearly as dangerous as it feels right now. Don't get married to that CA125 number alone.

I liked that my top pick was both a medical and surgical oncologist and had plenty of experience with robotic surgery. Luckily, my sister is a nurse and asked a colleague whose mom is a nurse navigator about my top pick. She said, \"she's great\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   4   |  1755961237 | 2025-08-23 15:00:37+00:00 |\n",

Practically begging, I asked if I could be put on a wait list or called if there were any cancellations. I was told they could ask the doctor if she can squeeze me in and I got an appt a week and a half later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |             |                           |\n",

My oncologist told me they’d track it, and by the next scan it was gone. He said nodules can be found in almost anyone, whether they have cancer or not, and they’re almost always benign/transient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |   3   |  1755796448 | 2025-08-21 17:14:08+00:00 |\n",

Had several,. 2 involved large amounts of fluid & 1 was much less. Had thoracentesis each time. Went 13 months post chemo before I had a recurrence, accompanied by yet another pleural effusion & another thora. Went back on chemo again & did well. Fast forward to now (been on maintenance w Zirabev the whole time after the last chemo session) & I haven't had another one or a recurrence in 2 years. My scans have shown zero or only trace signs of fluid since.                                                                                                                            |   2   |  1755980534 | 2025-08-23 20:22:14+00:00 |\n",

He was also very concerned because it was so large (16 cm) and my CA125 was as really high (2060).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   3   |  1755634412 | 2025-08-19 20:13:32+00:00 |\n",

Agree, there's a serious lack of information about what is exactly happening and when. If you don't ask questions, no one will tell you, but how do you know to ask questions about when you haven't been through this before? I miss the days where there were at least pamphlets everywhere. Ask questions, for your own peace of mind! I know it's hard. Being able to search online has been really helpful for me. Or just make sure you ask every tech from now on \"What can I expect?\" It sucks that that's on us, sometimes, though. I have been lucky with techs explaining everything really in-depth, so far. There definitely doesn't seem to be enough time to walk people through in their own time, I'm sure all our health systems are overwhelmed.                                        |   1   |  1756677344 | 2025-08-31 21:55:44+00:00 |\n",
