       "[\"Breast cancer before kids: Hi, fellow brca carriers!\\n\\nHow do you go about handling societal expectations to have kids if you've had cancer before kids? \\n\\nI got married a year and a half ago. 2 months after our wedding, my MRI showed breast cancer. I had a bilateral mastectomy and now I'm on tamoxifen for the next 10 years. We're allowed to pause the tamoxifen after 2 years to try for pregnancy. We have one healthy embryo that doesn't have BRCA. Last night we told my husband's parents about the embryo and they were overjoyed! We swore them to secrecy because my parents and most of my support system are Catholic to the max and just wouldn't support this decision. It felt so good to tell my in-laws! In this Catholic community, there's a lot of pressure to procreate. I have so many friends that are pregnant right now. Even more that have little kids. They want to get together with me but I don't have children, and when we get together as a group they all just talk about their experiences of motherhood. (Experiences that really make me miss having estrogen and make me feel like an alien!) \\n\\nI know all of them wonder what's going on with my health and fertility, but they are too kind to ask. I don't feel fully comfortable sharing. My therapist has recommended that I start to share. Not everyone is a safe space! Has anyone been through something like this? I'm not sure how to go about it and honestly I'm emotional about it so it all just feels very vulnerable. I wish I had some kind of catchphrase that I could share, but talking about my cancer at all seems to make everyone uncomfortable. I ended up telling one friend the whole story (minus the IVF) and asked if she could just spread the word. Hopefully, this makes everyone feel more comfortable.\",\n",

Therefore, after I have all the children I want, I want to do the preventive sugeries, e.g., removing breast, ovaries and uterus(??) also what is up with hormone replacement therapy? I have heard about it, but not sure what it really means. I would be happy if fellow BRCA2 positive ladies shared what kind of preventative surgeries they have had/will have. \\n\\nThank you in advance for sharing!',\n",

I’m 33 years old and also 8 weeks pregnant.\\n\\nThis is mostly a rant, but I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through something similar if you are out there. I keep cycling between feeling numb, terrified, and then angry and can’t pull myself out of this loop. \\n\\nI’m upset with my father for not pushing me to get tested sooner. Growing up, he vaguely mentioned that relatives had died of cancer, but it never sounded immediate or serious. Only recently, after I had to pull together a family history, did I realize just how many women in my family died young—around the age I am now. Maybe earlier testing might not have changed much, but I still wish I’d started screenings sooner.\\n\\nI was so excited about being pregnant—my husband and I have been trying for 7 months—but now I feel guilty about possibly passing this gene down, especially if we have a daughter.\\n\\nI’m also stressed that I can’t get a mammogram while pregnant. Logically, I know the risk is still relatively low at my age, but my mind keeps spiraling to the worst-case scenario: what if something is found, and I have to face an impossible choice between starting treatment and continuing the pregnancy.\\n\\nI’m overwhelmed thinking about the choices I am going to have to make around when to get my ovaries removed and when to get a mastectomy. I would love to have a second child but I fear that by the time we can have a second I should already start getting these preventative surgeries done. \\n\\nIf anyone has been through something similar and can offer any advice I would appreciate it. ❤️\\n\\n\\n',\n",

So now I'm back in it. My plastic surgeon suggested a reduction/lift followed by the PDMX and direct-to implants approx 3 months later. \\n\\nI did the first phase of the reduction/lift in May. It went great - totally healed, etc. Initially, they said for that part that recovery was 2-4 weeks. I felt like it took barely 2. Drains were out after less-than 1 week. And even with the drains, I was pretty mobile. \\n\\nSo, the next part is now scheduled for 9/23. They told me that obvi this one is a bigger deal, and that I'd have two drains each side, instead of 1-each, and that recovery would be like 6-8 weeks.\\n\\nSO my question is -- is recovery really that long? How long should I expect to be down; how long to expect drains? I live with husband and two young teens who are helpful and capable, but should I have my parents come out (across the country) to help? Husband can work from home the first few days, but will have to go back into the office. Kids will obvi be at school all day. Is it much harder/worse than the first procedure?\\n\\nDoes anyone have any insight to the healing portion? Will I need the extra help? I'm sure if my parents did not come out I can rely on my network for like meal trains, etc. \\n\\n  \\nTHANK YOU\",\n",

       " \"Disappointment after PDMX complications: BRCA2, just had my PDMX 2 weeks ago Wednesday (after a lift/reduction in January of this year). I had my post-op last week (1 week out) and my plastic surgeon said he didn't like the look of some of the skin on my left side, but he wanted to give it another week so I went back in today. It's looking better but unfortunately I will need to have another procedure to remove some of the skin that isn't going to pull through. He did say that it's going to be significantly less than he anticipated, so I'm clinging to that silver lining. I'm back in Thursday so he can evaluate if I'm as healed as I'm going to get, or if he needs to wait another week. I might have this procedure as early as Friday. I unfortunately also have to keep my drains in.\\n\\nI'm just struggling a lot emotionally. I trust my surgeons, and I know logically that this isn't anything I did or didn't do...but I'm feeling like it's a personal moral failing and I can't seem to shake that feeling. I'm the first of 4 BRCA2+ diagnosed female cousins on my mom's side to be able to have this procedure preventatively - 1 found cancer at her pre-op mammogram, 1 had DCIS, and another is dealing with metastatic breast cancer right now. I am so incredibly lucky. And I have an amazingly supportive family, and my husband has great insurance through his work so I'm not paying out of pocket for pretty much anything. I recognize how privileged I am, and I'm grateful.\\n\\nI'm feeling this weird combination of survivor's guilt (I guess pre-vivor's guilt?) and shame and frustration. I think a part of me thought that since I was able to get this procedure preventatively that I had avoided the big bad outcome, so obviously that meant good outcomes for everything else? I know that's naive, but after sailing through recovery from the lift and reduction I assumed this procedure would go the same - maybe take a bit longer to recover, but I didn't anticipate this. My youngest daughter starts Kindergarten next week and I planned this whole thing so that I'd be more or less back on my feet by the time I had to walk her up to the bus stop at the end of our driveway. And regrettably life doesn't pause just because I'm recovering from surgery - and as lucky as I have been to be a stay at home mom these last 7 years, my kids are young enough that they still need me for a lot (or at least think they do) so it's not like I just get to focus solely on recovery.\\n\\nI knew this would be a good place to come vent - my husband tries his best and I know he's there to support me no matter what, but he can't really understand some of the deeper underlying issues I'm processing through. Thanks for letting me vent.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nipple complications post pdm - unsure what to do: I had my PDM nipple sparing in May 2024 (with implants). I had some ischemia on one side but thankfully it did not turn into necrosis, it kind of turned dark and scabbed over, and then healed fine. \\n\\nFast forward some time, I started having occasional nipple discharge (usually after a shower/maybe from the heat) and that nipple felt “tighter” on that side, I just assumed it was because that side was always smaller and maybe there was just more room on my left breast with the implant. \\n\\nI had an ultrasound and they were concerned by what they saw. I had a biopsy which cleared any malignancy and they found PASH, which I think is a type of normal breast tissue. I’ve since had another follow up ultrasound and the area is ill-defined but not growing. I’ve also been having more pain on that side only when I touch or massage, it’s just achey and not like the other side. I asked my surgeon and she said given the circumstances, she isn’t too concerned and thinks it’s just breast tissue that is left behind (which we know happens with mastectomy especially with nipple sparing) and likely as a result of some healing post necrosis. \\n\\nEssentially my surgeon said if it’s really bothering me (pain wise, the nipple discharge) or just giving me stress/anxiety she can remove the nipple. My initial thought was no I can just suck it up but now I’m doubting myself, is there too much breast tissue left behind? Do I want to be dealing with these symptoms, even though they are fairly mild? She suggested I reach out to my reconstructive surgeon to see if he has any suggestions. \\n\\nI think I need some advice on what factors I should consider with this decision. My biggest concern is my risk being higher with the tissue that’s there, but we know that mastectomy is not 100% with or without the nipples. If I choose to remove it, I may as well do both sides, and that’s a big surgery, for potentially more complications but maybe better peace of mind and no achey pain? And look wise I don’t know how they will manage removing the nipples after mastectomy has already been done. I don’t even know how to begin to sort out my thoughts!

I keep learning more about the benefits for both baby and mom- including a 26% reduction in ovarian cancer for moms who breast feed!! This ovarian cancer risk reduction is new to me, and seems huge since there is no way to screen for ovarian cancer. And to be completely vulnerable, I haven’t been able to stop grieving the loss of this experience to bond with my future baby.\\n\\nI am currently monitoring with MRI every 6 months. I know that delaying my mastectomy until I have a baby and complete 6 months of breastfeeding would throw off that schedule somewhat, but I can say with confidence that I would continue monitoring as much as possible.\\n\\nMy risk of breast cancer during this time period is still quite low (I would still plan to have surgery before age 35, and I have a BRCA2 mutation). However, I have read over and over in this sub that catching breast cancer early- even as early as possible- is still very hard on the body (and, obviously, the mind). My question is:\\n\\nWhat actually happens when they catch an early stage (say stage 0 or stage 1) breast cancer?\\n\\nDo you get chemo? Radiation? Both? How long is treatment? What are the long term effects of chemo and radiation? How does it affect your long term chances of cancer elsewhere in the body?

Most people with an answer to this question will have gone through the incredibly traumatic experience of receiving a cancer diagnosis. You may be scratching your head at how someone could possibly even think that waiting on surgery is worth the risk of what you went through, and that’s fair. I am simply lost in a huge cloud of uncertainty, and a 5-10% risk (in my late 20s and early 30s with a BRCA2 mutation) of a diagnosis which results in immediate surgery and 3 months of recovery does feel different to me than a 5-10% risk of a diagnosis which puts family and career plans on pause for 2 years.

There isn’t a high-risk breast program. I was told that the OBGYNs were specialized in my mutation, so I made an appointment.

Keeping my nipples was something that I personally had wanted and it appears that they have survived! \\nMy surgeon placed expanders under the muscle and filled them slightly so I would not be flat when I woke up. \\nMy partner has helped at home which has been a huge help in my recovery. We strip drains twice daily since I have such low output. \\nOnce my other drains are out I will attempt to go on some small walks.\\nI have spotty sensation in my chest and I’m unsure what that will be like in the end.  Looking forward to getting fills to inflate my chest some more. I personally have not had expander discomfort, but it could be because my surgeon did fill them slightly.\\nJust wanted to give some folks some clarity on the process, I’m happy to answer any questions for those on the fence ',\n",

       " \"Double Mastectomy at 20: Hello all! I just wanted some advice/encouragement :) I recently tested positive for BRCA1. My family has a history of breast/ovarian cancer. I am currently a college student (20F) getting ready for medical school next year. \\n\\nGiven my mom's' personal history of having very late stage breast cancer and my aunt dying from ovarian cancer, preventative surgeries are becoming a very dire topic currently. I have recently visited a breast reconstructionist and am about to have a consultation with a breast oncologist. \\n\\nHonestly, I am very scared. I thought I was fine, but the thought of having such major surgeries is making me anxious. What kind of surgeries would cause the least scarring and would be most ideal in terms of checkups/aesthetics? I am definitely going to go the non nipple sparing route, but am stuck between autologous or implants. \\n\\nWhat worries me is losing feeling in my chest, the scars, and the nipples. I know that in the grand scheme of things, my health matters most, but not being able to feel is really tripping me up. And yes, aesthetics do matter to me haha. Hopefully, these are all valid concerns that others can relate to as well.\\n\\nIs 20 too young of an age to do this? Ideally, I wish I could do this after having kids and being able to breast feed, but it's not like I can ask potential breast cancer to go away until I'm done with the things I want lol. Unfortunately, even if I can do it later, my parents will probably force me to get it done. Please don't say things that I already know like that I have the right to my own body and that I'm an adult. I do know how my parents are and they will definitely fight with me everyday (commuting student) and stress me until I comply. \\n\\nThank you for reading and for the advice!\",\n",

This is hard to go through without all of this. \\n\\nI see the PS again Monday. He currently has me using Silvadene 2x per day and covering it with a non-stick pad. I am on 2 oral antibiotics to guard against infection. The sloughing seems to be gone and no sign of necrosis. It just looks so bad. I have been suprisingly good with the incisions and seeing my new body. This has taken a turn with this wound opening up and I just want to cry when I have to attend to the wound twice per day.

Right now, genetic mutation is unknown but I have a family history of breast cancer (mother and maternal grandmother) an atypia diagnosis, and dense breasts, so my current risk is hovering around 40%. I’m having a very hard time mentally with the bi-yearly imaging and subsequent biopsies and procedures and so I’m strongly leaning toward prophylactic mastectomy. \\n\\nI initially thought I would just go flat, but lately, I’ve been feeling like this whole process might feel easier for me mentally and emotionally if I knew I’d have something resembling breasts after. However, I’m rather thin and have very small breasts as it is, so not sure DIEP would work for me. My title uses the word ‘holistic’ because I’m very particular about what goes in and on my body - no parabens or phthalates, heck, I don’t even take a vitamin without researching it first. (Note: Holistic but not crazy Instagram influencer style.) I vehemently opposed implants, but now I’m starting to wonder if it’s possible to be both holistic and have them. Has anyone here who identifies as holistic gotten implants and had a good experience and still feel confident in their decision today? I’m also a very active person and work out quite a bit, and I know going flat has the fastest recovery time.

My silicone implants were placed above the muscle and I was honestly very happy with how they looked. Unfortunately I had skin necrosis from the mastectomy and had to have the implants removed ~6 weeks post-op to prevent infection. My surgeon cut out the necrotic tissue and I went flat with the plan to retry reconstruction in a few months. Now that several months have passed we are revisiting the idea. My surgeon is recommending expanders prior to implants, which I am fine with since the skin is still pretty fragile. Today my surgeon also suggested that the expanders/implants are placed under the muscle this time for an additional layer of protection given the questionable skin integrity. I am conflicted bc I was fully content with my prior reconstruction (prior to the necrosis) and was hoping to eventually get back to that same final result, which now seems like it may not be possible.
